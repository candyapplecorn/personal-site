a pretty little page about me

## Contact Form

The site is hosted on GitHub pages, which means there's no server processes (apart from serving static resources). Normally, sending mail requires a server. The web browser can't just send mail. Yet there's a contact form on this webpage that sends mail. This is accomplished by sending the contact form's information as POST data to a *different* server configured to send mail: formspree.

### TODO: Make the project about blurbs hidden or something, and change the links. Plus the line height on the about blurbs should change on desktop view
